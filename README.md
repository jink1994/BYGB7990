Hi everyone,
This is a spider project on yelp.
I basicly crawled the information of ice cream shops in new york, with this link:'https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Ice%20Cream&find_loc=10023'

Parsed the page using bueatifulsoup package on python and created time intervals to avoid being blocked by Yelp.
